            <h2>A little bit of me</h2>
            <p>My name is Brunella, but I like to be called Nella.. I came into this world on April 16, 2006, which means that I am 18 years old now :c, I grew up in the city of Tacna with my parents and my older brother until I was 2 years old, because of my dad's work we had to move to Arequipa which is where I live to this day, everything was going well until my younger siblings were born whom I love very much but sometimes they fill my patience. I spent elementary school in a small school in the Jacobo Hunter district. And I finished my upper and secondary school at the Padre Damian de los Sagrados Corazones school.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have carried out various activities throughout my school years, including:
                Practice basketball, volleyball and handball.
                I practice piano and guitar.
                I like and relax listening to music too much.
                I love reading youth books or poems.
                I know it's not a hobby, but I also really like going to sleep.
                Compared to most of my peers, I don't play any video games.</p>
